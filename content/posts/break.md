<pre class="poem">
    Was it me, or was it you?
    Was it day, or was it moon?
    A gentle orbit, slow and long,
    dancing together song after song.

    <!--
    Was it me, or was it you?
    I want to know, I want to know,
    Scattered in the falling leaves,
    or burried in the winter snow?

    Was it me, or was it you?
    and were they lies, or was it true?
    I suspect we&apos;ll never know,
    Ebb and flow, and ebb and flow.
-->
</pre>
