Those were not my words, old friend
just the song of mourning birds
still now drifting on the wind.

What you may have heard, old friend
were the whipsers of the trees
as their withered leaves descend.

And, not much has stirred, old friend
still, an echo lingers here
though our time has found its end.

    All ye who wander here,
    maidens vile, maidens fair,
    wear a smile, have no fear,
    send me word, if you dare.

    Was it me, or was it you?
    Was it day, or was it moon?
    A gentle orbit, slow and long,
    dancing together song after song.

    &lt;!--
    Was it me, or was it you?
    I want to know, I want to know,
    Scattered in the falling leaves,
    or burried in the winter snow?

    Was it me, or was it you?
    and were they lies, or was it true?
    I suspect we&amp;apos;ll never know,
    Ebb and flow, and ebb and flow.
