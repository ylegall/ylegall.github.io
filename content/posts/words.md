<pre class="poem">
Those were not my words, old friend
just the song of mourning birds
still now drifting on the wind.

What you may have heard, old friend
were the whipsers of the trees
as their withered leaves descend.

And, not much has stirred, old friend
still, an echo lingers here
though our time has found its end.
