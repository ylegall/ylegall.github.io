    All ye who wander here,
    maidens vile, maidens fair,
    wear a smile, have no fear,
    send me word, if you dare.

    Was it me, or was it you?
    I want to know, I want to know,
    Scattered in the falling leaves,
    or burried in the winter snow?

    Was it me, or was it you?
    Was it day, or was it moon?
    Dancing slowly to our song,
    a waltz that started all too soon.

    Was it me, or was it you?
    and were they lies, or was it true?

    I suspect we&amp;apos;ll never know,
    Ebb and flow and ebb and flow.
&lt;/pre&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
